            Life w u

            My dear,
            Did u know that its been only 110 days <br>
            that we’ve truly spoken, <br>
            Though it feels like ive known you since forever? <br>

        <p>
            … continuation …

        </p>


        It’s so strange how i feel so safe around you<br>
        Like i could trust my whole life to you<br>
        I might be exaggerating, or maybe not<br>
        I might be in love, or maybe yes<br>
        But im sure of one thing..<br>
        Life sounds so exciting with u<br>
        The future sounds so exciting with u<br>

        I love u and i hope to love you even more as the days passes by<br>
        I miss u and i can’t wait to be by your side<br>
        Juts know that you are perfect<br>
        and everything that I’ve ever wanted and more

        </p>
